We were welcomed with fresh coconut water and a warm introduction, followed by a lovely boat ride to our cabana. The cabana had everything we needed and we had such a great time together. The BBQ was fantastic! And the boat ride back at dusk… breathtaking, especially with the birds we saw along the way. I wish you a wonderful future with many happy guests. Warm regards,"

Not at Sendang Redjo: it feels as if you’re completely alone in the world, and you return recharged instead of overstimulated. A true hidden gem of serene beauty! The cabana had everything we needed, the food was delicious, the service was excellent, and we all enjoyed swimming, kayaking and real quality time. Thank you again — we will definitely be back!"
